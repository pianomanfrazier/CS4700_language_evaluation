# Sample web app with Elm

This is the result of playing around with Elm for a few weeks. Go [here](https://pianomanfrazier.github.io/CS4700_language_evaluation/) to see it in action.

The app is a simple password validator as found in the [Elm tutorials](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/user_input/forms.html) in the Documentation. I implemented the exercises found at the end of the tutorial.

- Check that the password is longer than 8 characters.
- Make sure the password contains upper case, lower case, and numeric characters.
- Add an additional field for age and check that it is a number.
- Add a "Submit" button. Only show errors after it has been pressed.
